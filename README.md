Web-based Gemini models wrapped into an OpenAI-compatible API. Powered by [HanaokaYuzu/Gemini-API](https://github.com/HanaokaYuzu/Gemini-API).

**✅ Call Gemini's web-based models via API without an API Key, completely free!**

## Features

- **🔐 No Google API Key Required**: Use web cookies to freely access Gemini's models via API.
- **🔍 Google Search Included**: Get up-to-date answers using web-based Gemini's search capabilities.
- **💾 Conversation Persistence**: LMDB-based storage supporting multi-turn conversations.
- **🖼️ Multi-modal Support**: Support for handling text, images, and file uploads.
- **⚖️ Multi-account Load Balancing**: Distribute requests across multiple accounts with per-account proxy settings.

## Quick Start

**For Docker deployment, see the [Docker Deployment](#docker-deployment) section below.**

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.13
- Google account with Gemini access on web
- `secure_1psid` and `secure_1psidts` cookies from Gemini web interface

### Installation

#### Using uv (Recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nativu5/Gemini-FastAPI.git
cd Gemini-FastAPI
uv sync
```

#### Using pip

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nativu5/Gemini-FastAPI.git
cd Gemini-FastAPI
pip install -e .
```

### Configuration

Edit `config/config.yaml` and provide at least one credential pair:

```yaml
gemini:
  clients:
    - id: "client-a"
      secure_1psid: "YOUR_SECURE_1PSID_HERE"
      secure_1psidts: "YOUR_SECURE_1PSIDTS_HERE"
      proxy: null # Optional proxy URL (null/empty keeps direct connection)
```

> [!NOTE]
> For details, refer to the [Configuration](#configuration-1) section below.

### Running the Server

```bash
# Using uv
uv run python run.py

# Using Python directly
python run.py
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:8000` by default.

## API Endpoints

The server provides several endpoints, including OpenAI-compatible ones.

### OpenAI-Compatible Endpoints

These endpoints are designed to be compatible with OpenAI's API structure, allowing you to use Gemini as a drop-in replacement.

- **`GET /v1/models`**: Lists all supported Gemini models.
- **`POST /v1/images/generations`**: Dedicated high-performance stateless image generation endpoint (OpenAI compatible).
  - **Zero Local Disk I/O**: Direct high-res Google CDN URLs (`url`) or memory-only Base64 (`b64_json`), eliminating local disk write bottlenecks.
  - **Early Return**: Intercepts images from the stream immediately and cuts off subsequent text generation, drastically reducing latency.
  - **Bypasses LMDB Storage**: Fully stateless, uses Google temporary chat mode (not recorded to cloud account history).
  - **Multi-Account Failover Retry**: Automatically retries across available accounts in the pool if an account fails or refuses to draw.
- **`POST /v1/chat/completions`**: Unified chat interface.
  - **Streaming**: Set `stream: true` to receive real-time delta chunks.
  - **Multi-modal**: Supports text, images, and file uploads.
  - **Tool Calling**: Supports function calling via the `tools` parameter.
  - **Structured Output**: Supports `response_format` for JSON schema enforcement.

### Advanced Endpoints

- **`POST /v1/responses`**: An alternative endpoint for complex interaction patterns, supporting rich output items including generated images and tool calls.

### Utility Endpoints

- **`GET /health`**: Health check endpoint. Returns the status of the server, configured Gemini clients, and conversation storage.
- **`GET /images/{filename}`**: Internal endpoint to serve generated images. Requires a valid token (automatically included in image URLs returned by the API).

## Docker Deployment

### Run with Options

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 \
  -v $(pwd)/data:/app/data \
  -v $(pwd)/cache:/app/cache \
  -e CONFIG_SERVER__API_KEY="your-api-key-here" \
  -e CONFIG_GEMINI__CLIENTS__0__ID="client-a" \
  -e CONFIG_GEMINI__CLIENTS__0__SECURE_1PSID="your-secure-1psid" \
  -e CONFIG_GEMINI__CLIENTS__0__SECURE_1PSIDTS="your-secure-1psidts" \
  -e GEMINI_COOKIE_PATH="/app/cache" \
  ghcr.io/nativu5/gemini-fastapi
```

> [!TIP]
> Add `CONFIG_GEMINI__CLIENTS__N__PROXY` only if you need a proxy; omit the variable to keep direct connections.
>
> `GEMINI_COOKIE_PATH` points to the directory inside the container where refreshed cookies are stored. Bind-mounting it (e.g. `-v $(pwd)/cache:/app/cache`) preserves those cookies across container rebuilds/recreations so you rarely need to re-authenticate.

### Run with Docker Compose

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
services:
  gemini-fastapi:
    image: ghcr.io/nativu5/gemini-fastapi:latest
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    volumes:
      # - ./config:/app/config      # Uncomment to use a custom config file
      # - ./certs:/app/certs        # Uncomment to enable HTTPS with your certs
      - ./data:/app/data
      - ./cache:/app/cache
    environment:
      - CONFIG_SERVER__HOST=0.0.0.0
      - CONFIG_SERVER__PORT=8000
      - CONFIG_SERVER__API_KEY=${API_KEY}
      - CONFIG_GEMINI__CLIENTS__0__ID=client-a
      - CONFIG_GEMINI__CLIENTS__0__SECURE_1PSID=${SECURE_1PSID}
      - CONFIG_GEMINI__CLIENTS__0__SECURE_1PSIDTS=${SECURE_1PSIDTS}
      - GEMINI_COOKIE_PATH=/app/cache # must match the cache volume mount above
    restart: on-failure:3 # Avoid retrying too many times
```

Then run:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure to mount the `/app/data` volume to persist conversation data between container restarts.
> Also mount `/app/cache` so refreshed cookies (including rotated 1PSIDTS values) survive container rebuilds/recreates without re-auth.

## Configuration

The server reads a YAML configuration file located at `config/config.yaml`.

For details on each configuration option, refer to the comments in the [`config/config.yaml`](https://github.com/Nativu5/Gemini-FastAPI/blob/main/config/config.yaml) file.

### Environment Variable Overrides

> [!TIP]
> This feature is particularly useful for Docker deployments and production environments where you want to keep sensitive credentials separate from configuration files.

You can override any configuration option using environment variables with the `CONFIG_` prefix. Use double underscores (`__`) to represent nested keys, for example:

```bash
# Override server settings
export CONFIG_SERVER__API_KEY="your-secure-api-key"

# Override Gemini credentials for client 0
export CONFIG_GEMINI__CLIENTS__0__ID="client-a"
export CONFIG_GEMINI__CLIENTS__0__SECURE_1PSID="your-secure-1psid"
export CONFIG_GEMINI__CLIENTS__0__SECURE_1PSIDTS="your-secure-1psidts"

# Override optional proxy settings for client 0
export CONFIG_GEMINI__CLIENTS__0__PROXY="socks5://127.0.0.1:1080"

# Override conversation storage size limit
export CONFIG_STORAGE__MAX_SIZE=268435456  # 256 MB
```

### Client IDs and Conversation Reuse

Conversations are stored with the ID of the client that generated them.
Keep these identifiers stable in your configuration so that sessions remain valid
when you update the cookie list.

### Gemini Credentials

> [!WARNING]
> Keep these credentials secure and never commit them to version control. These cookies provide access to your Google account.

To use Gemini-FastAPI, you need to extract your Gemini session cookies:

1. Open [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/) in a private/incognito browser window and sign in
2. Open Developer Tools (F12)
3. Navigate to **Application** → **Storage** → **Cookies**
4. Find and copy the values for:
   - `__Secure-1PSID`
   - `__Secure-1PSIDTS`

> [!TIP]
> For detailed instructions, refer to the [HanaokaYuzu/Gemini-API authentication guide](https://github.com/HanaokaYuzu/Gemini-API?tab=readme-ov-file#authentication).

### Proxy Settings

Each client entry can be configured with a different proxy to work around rate limits. Omit the `proxy` field or set it to `null` or an empty string to keep a direct connection.

### Chat Session Mode

You can control whether requests use normal Google chats or Google's temporary chat mode:

```yaml
gemini:
  chat_mode: "normal" # "normal" (reuse metadata) or "temporary" (Google temporary chat, not saved to account)
  max_chars_per_request: 1000000
  oversized_context_strategy: "compaction" # "compaction" or "file"
```

When `chat_mode` is set to `temporary`, the server applies an internal effective input limit of 90% of `max_chars_per_request`.
When context exceeds the effective budget, handling is controlled by `oversized_context_strategy`:
- `compaction`: summarize older turns and keep recent turns verbatim.
- `file`: attach oversized context as `message.txt` and process it from file.

Environment variable equivalents:

```bash
export CONFIG_GEMINI__CHAT_MODE="temporary"
export CONFIG_GEMINI__MAX_CHARS_PER_REQUEST=1000000
export CONFIG_GEMINI__OVERSIZED_CONTEXT_STRATEGY="compaction"
```

### Custom Models

You can define custom models in `config/config.yaml` or via environment variables.

#### YAML Configuration

```yaml
gemini:
  model_strategy: "append" # "append" (default + custom) or "overwrite" (custom only)
  models:
    - model_name: "gemini-3.0-pro"
      model_header:
        x-goog-ext-525001261-jspb: '[1,null,null,null,"9d8ca3786ebdfbea",null,null,0,[4],null,null,1]'
```

#### Environment Variables

You can supply models as a JSON string or list structure via `CONFIG_GEMINI__MODELS`. This provides a flexible way to override settings via the shell or in automated environments (e.g. Docker) without modifying the configuration file.

```bash
export CONFIG_GEMINI__MODEL_STRATEGY="overwrite"
export CONFIG_GEMINI__MODELS='[{"model_name": "gemini-3.0-pro", "model_header": {"x-goog-ext-525001261-jspb": "[1,null,null,null,\"9d8ca3786ebdfbea\",null,null,0,[4],null,null,1]"}}]'
```
